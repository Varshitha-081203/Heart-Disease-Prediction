# ❤️ Heart Disease Prediction using Machine Learning

This project predicts the likelihood of heart disease in a patient based on medical attributes such as age, chest pain type, cholesterol levels, blood pressure, and maximum heart rate. The goal is to assist early diagnosis using machine learning-based risk assessment.

The project includes data preprocessing, exploratory analysis, model training, performance evaluation, and prediction using multiple classification algorithms.

## 📉 Model Performance

| Model               | Accuracy |
| ------------------- | -------- |
| Logistic Regression | ~85%     |
| Random Forest       | ~88%     |
| KNN                 | ~82%     |

*(Performance may vary based on dataset and tuning.)*
